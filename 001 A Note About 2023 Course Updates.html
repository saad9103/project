<p>Hey guys,</p><p>This course was initially produced in 2018. Over time, technology changes so we've made small improvements and additions as needed. </p><p>But sometimes, much more extensive updates are required. So during the entire year of 2023, we've been completely re-recording and revamping this course. 80% of the course is now brand-new. </p><p>This includes new sections that never existed in previous versions of this course, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Flexbox</p></li><li><p>Grid</p></li><li><p>Postgres</p></li></ul><p>We've moved away from Mongo to Postgres because our research on tech recruitment showed us that companies are looking for more SQL-based DB competence and moving away from Mongo and NoSQL. </p><p>50+ hours of new content has been created and added to this course this year. So you can be assured that you are working through an up to date version of a Web Development Bootcamp. </p><p>Wishing you all the success in the world,</p><p>Your instructor,</p><p>Angela</p>
